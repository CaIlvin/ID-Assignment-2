This project is an ambitious studio project of creating a web game. The name of the game will be called "Earth Defender", a space invader insipired game.

## Design Process

This website is for those that wants a blast from the past of arcade game while being reinvented in our rendition of the game. This website is in hope of acheiving a retroactive arcade style of memory with this project heavily trying to recreate that experience.
